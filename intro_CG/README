This collection of codes is done while learning basics of computer graphics.
The main idea I have tried to follow is to use only basic C++ facilities, std::
libraries.
I am not using OpenGL, but rather writing the results to images in format PPM
which makes it less comfortable to observe the results (it is necessary to open
the image in some viewer after running the program to see the result). However,
it also allows for better understanding of the process.
The codes are created in C++ only and in Linux environment. They might compile
and run in other OSs, but I do not promise that :)
