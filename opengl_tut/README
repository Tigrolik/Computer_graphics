Here I have a collection of codes while following the OpenGL tutorial on
http://learnopengl.com/

The codes created in Linux, so to have them working it is assumed to have OpenGL
ver3.3 libraries (GLEW, GLFW etc.) for C++ as well as a compiler for C++11.
Some OpenGL libraries can be installed on (L)ubuntu using apt-get:
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libglfw3-dev (or libglfw-dev) libsoil-dev
libglm-dev

Note: there might be a problem during compilation with flag -lglfw. If that
happens you might try to change it to -lglfw3 or install/reinstall libglfw.
