Here I have a collection of codes while following the OpenGL tutorial on
http://learnopengl.com/

The codes created in Linux, so to have them working it is assumed to have OpenGL
ver3.3 libraries (GLEW, GLFW etc.) for C++ as well as a compiler for C++11.
Some OpenGL libraries can be installed on (L)ubuntu using apt-get:
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libsoil-dev libglm-dev
